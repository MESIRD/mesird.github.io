Today I found that our project still had no formal database document, so I decided to collect and write one.  
There was a problem happen to me when I wanted to format the data from database client to my document, I mean there were too many tables and it's an hard job for me to copy and paste them one by one by my hand...  
Then I found I can select the useful information from database then copy them to my document table, this is the reason why I write this blog, to share some retained variables of mysql.  
waiting for updating...
